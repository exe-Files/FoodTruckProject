# Food Truck Project

### Overview
This program simulates a review site for a Food Truck. It takes in the inputs of up to five different trucks, including the name, type of food, and the rating. 
Once the user has input their ratings, a menu will be presented and the user can choose from the selection.

### Technologies Used
- Java 
- Conditionals
- Looping
- Classes
- Objects 
- Methods

### How to Run
- In order to run, you must run a version of Java 1.8 or later and a copy of Eclipse. 
- Open Eclipse and import the project
- Run Java FoodTruckApp
- Input the Food Trucks you would like to review, including the name, type of food they serve, and your rating. 
- When finished, you can enter 'quit' into the name field or enter five separate entries. 
- A menu will populate and allow you to select an output based on a number you input
- Voila, you're done!

### Lessons Learned
Working on this project has brought to my own attention how shakey I am when it comes to a lot of these concepts, especially classes and objects. Creating methods and working them into my code, refactoring as I go is another area that I'm not entirely sure of how to accomplish without breaking my code.
